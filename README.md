> 🔐 Lite / 🔐 Pro (coming)

Blah isn’t just a Q&A system.  
It’s a **semantic simulator** for dialectical reasoning, paradox handling, and emotionally nuanced response generation — all in `.txt` format.

Designed as a human-readable "embedding generator,"  
Blah makes language models **think in layers** — not just guess.
